I would use the hashed quest log, since it stores the keys - which are atomic
objects (Strings). An array of Strings is easy to sort compared to compound
data types. The tradeoff cost with the Hashed Quest Log is wsated memory space,
but if my primary use is displaying all information, then the speed benefits are
worth the tradeoff.

I would use the tree quest log, since it provides the most memory efficient data
storage, which is worth the timing complexity cost since accesses are only
periodic.
