// This project uses a JAR called opencsv which is a library for reading and
// writing CSV (comma-separated value) files.
// 
// You don't need to do this for this project, because it's already done, but
// if you want to use opencsv in other projects on your own, here's the process:
//
// 1. Download opencsv-3.1.jar from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencsv/
// 2. Drag opencsv-3.1.jar into your project.
// 3. Right-click on the project in the package explorer, select "Properties" (at bottom of popup menu)
// 4. Choose the "Libraries" tab
// 5. Click "Add JARs"
// 6. Select the opencsv-3.1.jar from within your project from the list.
// 7. At the top of your .java file add the following imports:
//        import java.io.FileReader;
//        import com.opencsv.CSVReader;
//
// Reference documentation for opencsv is here:  
// http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/apidocs/overview-summary.html
